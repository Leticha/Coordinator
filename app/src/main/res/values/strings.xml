    <string name="letra_cancion">Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting
(We got the refugees up in here) no fighting
No fighting
Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this (hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (¡sí!), bonita (¡sí!)?
Mi casa (Shakira, Shakira), su casa

Oh, baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (¡sí!) and keep on (¡sí!)
Reading the signs of my body (uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats, boats (no fighting)

I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (no fighting, no fighting)

Oh, you know I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting
